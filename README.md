# NNscratch
Creating an MNIST NN from scratch without any external libraries except NumPy. I will be doing a few different optimizators, activation functions and all that. 


Would also be cool to see if I could GA the optimal net dimensions just for funs


# Structure

Structure is adabtable! Just change the network creation parameters in the file `nnscratch.py`, on line 114. The input layer and the output layers are stable, everything else can be changed freely. Bigger nets naturally take up more computation time, though.

 - Input layer: flattened 28x28=784
 - Output layer: reduce to last 10




# Usage

First, get the dataset from `http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/`

Then make sure that the files containing images and labels are in the same
