# NNscratch
Creating an MNIST NN from scratch without any external libraries except NumPy. The basic structure is there, sometimes it works and sometimes not. I wonder how to go from here


# Structure

Structure is adabtable! Just change the network creation parameters in the file `nnscratch.py`

 - Input layer: flattened 28x28=784
 - First hidden layer: reduce to 128
 - Second hidden layer: reduce to 64
 - Output layer: reduce to last 10
